                The Paranormal Investigator Who Is Herself Paranormal

![what](https://github.com/wemmm/concordia/blob/master/what.PNG)

Another text-based adventure game! But also with images, so not actually an entirely text-based adventure game. More of a visual novel really. This is probably going to be a lengthy process because I need to make assets and write stuff.

The apparently noteworthy and sort of 16-bit looking adventures of Concordia Jones, a paranormal investigator with three eyes, and her cat/friend/social media manager Sebastian Pitchforqu√©. Investigate mysteries of a paranormal or non-paranormal nature in the Neon District of Future Retro City!

* A bunch of old sketches

# Usage

This will eventually be an actual cross-platform application rather than a web-based thing. Expect some sort of useful link here when I have something worth demoing.

# Credits

Various articles of design and writing were co-created with the deeply appreciated assistance of my long-time collaborator/art partner/hive mind associate "The Local Poet".
